## v2.0-beta5

The composer package to install has now changed to `getcandy/admin`. This is to support our new monorepo [getcandy/getcandy](https://github.com/getcandy/getcandy)


## v2.0-beta

GetCandy 2 is a complete re-write of our e-commerce page. It is not currently possible to upgrade from v0.12.* to GetCandy 2.

GetCandy 2 provides both the core e-commerce functionality and also an integrated admin hub within Laravel. A separate package will be released early 2022 to provide frontend API functionality.
